Hi there font fans! Tired of your everyday bold type? Need something with a little more punch? Need a hero? Enter Thunder Lord. This outlined variant of Raiderfont is a faithful translation with
a few tweaks and changes. This display font features only uppercase letters and limited punctuation. The lightning bolt can be keyed by pressing the slash button. There are European accents and
kerning included. This font is free for any non commerical use. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license. I also design logos so drop me a line!
I accept donations at the same address via paypal. Your support is very much appreciated. Thanks for having a look!
